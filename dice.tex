It was 2004 when a TV show featured this amazing game. You could fly in planes and shoot them down with your machine gun. The game was
called ``Battlefield Vietnam''. I was impressed. The next week I bought the game, but our PC could not run it.
When the family got a new computer, I could finally experience the game. I have been a Battlefield enthusiast ever since.
Working is Sweden is a big bonus for me. I have already mastered the basics of the Swedish language and I want to learn more about the Swedish culture.

A distributed system of low-cost hardware can outperform most mainframes for a fraction of the cost.
They can perform this miracle by communicating and working together. But the need to communicate creates interesting challenges.
These obstacles can be overcome with creative solutions and by involving our partners. I would love to provide you with my talents to tackle
these issues so that the users will have the best possible experience.

As a professional Java developer, I gained experience in software engineering, teamwork, communication and customer interactions.
I am proactive, a critical thinker and a good listener that defends his ideas with rational arguments.
My most valuable talent is that I quickly grasp new ideas and that I can apply them in other contexts. This allows me to come up with unique solutions.
I embrace continuous learning to keep my technical skills sharp.

I would be delighted to elaborate on my motivation and competences in a personal interview,
