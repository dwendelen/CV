%Let's start with an anecdote, everyone likes anecdotes.
It was 2004 when a TV show featured this amazing game. You could fly in planes and shoot them down with your machine gun. The game was
called ``Battlefield Vietnam''. I was impressed. The next week I bought the game, but the PC could not run it.
When the family got a new computer, I could finally experience the game. I have been a Battlefield enthusiast ever since.
%This is why I want to work for DICE.

In modern AAA titles, stunning graphics are a billboard. But the competition is fierce and rendering those pretty pictures
is very challenging. It requires great artists, clever engineers and support from the rest of the game engine. It's like a big puzzle
that needs to be cracked. But we can only pull this off if we all put our backs behind it. I would love to pull that weight in a diverse team so
I can learn, teach and ultimately fulfill my full potential.

For my master thesis, I studied the architecture of the AMD Radeon HD 6970 and 
wrote OpenCL kernels that were optimised for that card. My C++ experience is limited to the basics, the principles from the book ''Effective C++'' and the
creation of a portable game in modern OpenGL. I am currently creating a Vulkan rendering engine for the game to gain a deeper insight into the graphics pipeline.
In University I also followed a course on computer graphics.
As a professional Java developer, I gained experience in software engineering, teamwork, communication and customer interactions. These competences are also important.

I would like to elaborate on my motivation and competences in a personal interview,
